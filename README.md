-👋 Hi, I’m @stalingcorderobrito
👀 I’m interested in education, research, science, technology, politics, and creating a significant impact in the Dominican Republic and Spain.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about digital citizenship, gamification in education, and innovative approaches to teaching STEM.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects, educational initiatives, and policies that promote science, technology, and innovation in higher education.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me via LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/staling-cordero-brito-ab2601210/)
